    <h1>Northeastern University Gym-Goers and the Relationship Between Academic Discipline and Strength</h1>

    <h2>Project Introduction</h1>
        <text> We wanted to dig deeper to understand the strengths across the various segments of the student population at Northeastern. We decided to settle on single-arm-bicep curls and barbell bench press as our focal points of measurement as we deemed these exercises to be the most common and quantifiable.
            
            <br>

            In order to test our research question, we collected data by surveying Northeastern University students as they walked into and exit the Marino Recreation Center. We used Google Forms to make data collection easier--the tie-in to other Google products and immediate recording of data made this method superior to manual data collection. Additionally, since some of the data we collected was potentially sensitive, such as weight and gender, we anonymized our data and didn't include information such as participantsâ€™ names. Additionally, we opted to give each respondent a unique ID number instead, which can be used to keep track of responses.
        
            <br>

            Our goal was to, generally, see if there was a correlation between a person's college and their strength.s

    <h2>Overall Data Summary Graph</h1>
        <p> This graph shows a scatter plot that measures bicep curl capabilities against bench press capabilities by college. The data shows a correlation between bicep curl and bench press strength and generally shows that Khoury college has stronger students. The data also features a tooltip that allows the user to see the bench press and bicep curl of each individual data point. This data functions as a good summary since you can see every school and all the strength attributes for each person.</p>

    <h2>Explanation of the Below Visualizations (Static Visualization 1)</h1>
        <p> The below four charts are broken out by gender and excercise type. We did this because each gender has significantly different strength profiles, and we figured that it would be useful to dissagregate this data. Additionally, these graphs also are broken out by exercise. We simply wanted to view the data on a single-variable basis, and these four graphs do exactly that. They break out the data more granularly that any other graphs we made for this project. Additionally, these graphs were the only graphs made with d3.js, as opposed to other graphs, which were made using tooltip. </p>

    <h2>Explanation of the Below Visualizations (Static Visualization 2)</h1>
        <p> The below graph shows the number of responses by college. This visualization was helpful because it shows the biggest flaw with our project, which was that the number of data points collected was likey insufficent to gather significant insights. Additionally, they show a skew toward the Khoury college of commputer science, suggesting that this cohort of students works out more than students in other colleges. </p>
    
    <h3>Number of Responses Per College</h3>

    <h2>Explanation of the Below Visualizations (Static Visualization 3)</h1>
        <p> The below graph shows a historgram of the different ages of the partipants we surveyed. They graph basically follows a normal distribution, with the peak around the 21. This makes sense, since we surveyed both undergraduate and graduate students. Additionally, we had some CPS students, which a cohort that skews older. This can be seen in the thin tail at the end of the histogram. </p>

    <h2>Explanation of the Below Visualizations (Interactive Visualization 1)</h1>
        <p> The below graph is another bicep curl vs. bench press graph, however this scatter plot includes a selection window that allows you to view the colleges the people in that window are in. The selection window is useful since it allows the user to view specific sections of the scatter (which may be hard to view and parse otherwise) and derive insights. We can see, for example, that Khoury College students dominate the stronger range of outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Explanation of the Below Visualizations (Interactive Visualization 2)</h2>
        <p> The below is another graph, this time in scatter form, that disaggregates survey responses by gender. However, unlike the above static bar charts, we combine the bench and bicep curl comparison but keep the gender comparison. From this graph, we can see that there in a stronger bicep curl to bench press strength correlation for men as opoposed to women. While not relflected in our visualizations, we speculate that this is due the fact that the average women we surveyed had worked out for a shorter period of time. </p>

    <h2>Explanation of the Below Visualizations (Interactive Visualization 3)</h1>
        <p> The below graph is a box plot that shows the range of bicep curl outcomes, including outliers, by college. We can see that the college of social sciences and humanities has the tighest range of outcomes, while the bouvÃ© college of health sciences had the widest range outcomes. However, the median outcome, with the exception of the khoury college, was around 32lbs for the bicep curl. </p>

    <h2>Summary</h1>
        <p> All in all, we conducted a relatively robust survey to find strength outcomes by college. We spoke to over 120 students, and made sure to get an equivalent number of male and female respondents. Although we did not get an eequivalent number of responses by college, the number of responses we got by college roughly followed the distribution of students in each of these colleges across the university. Our results, generally showed that men have stronger bicep/bench press outcomes and these two metrics are correlated, Khoury college students are the strongest cohort, and that Khoury college students frequent the gym more than any other college cohort.
            
        <br>
    
    If we were to redo this survey, we would speak to student from more universities, try to speak to an equivalent number of students by academic college, and measure another exercise like squats, that target a different part of the body.

        The first paper, published in the Journal of College Student Psychotherapy, examines various facets of mental health and looks at their prevalence by college majors (Lipson et al., 2016). When looking at the average â€˜Anyâ€™ score, which accounts for all mental health problems for STEM (NAT, ENG, PH, NURS, MED) vs. Non-STEM (SOC, HUM, ART, BUS, LAW, SW) academic disciplines, we see that STEM majors have an average â€˜Anyâ€™ score 4.35 points lower than their non-STEM counterparts. While mental health canâ€™t necessarily be used to extrapolate to physical health, we hope to use this data to inform our segmentation by academic discipline.

        The second paper (Kim et al., 2012) shows that there has already been research suggesting that using the one-rep max is a reliable way to quantifiably measure strength.  A data table (below) from their paper showed the reliability of using one-rep max testing for various exercises. This table contains values on the intraclass correlation coefficient and coefficient of variation. As we can see from the table, Bicep Curls and Bench Press are also both good indicator of overall strength.
